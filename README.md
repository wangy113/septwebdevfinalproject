Project Description: I created a portfolio to show off the skills I learned from the Web Development 1 course.

Requirements:
1) Create a responsive menu with CSS
2) Run PageSpeed Insights from google.com get a score of 60 or better
3) Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover.
4) Run an accessibility check and make and document the  adjustments in your readme

Accessibility Adjustments:
1) Every page should include a single H1 title: I removed the extra H1 titles.
2) Objects and embedded text of images should be described for assistive technology: I added "alt text" to all images.
